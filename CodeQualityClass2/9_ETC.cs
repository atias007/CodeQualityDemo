    /*
        * Don’t Repeat yourself (DRY). Express a logic once in your code
        * 
        * Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS). Ask yourself, “can this code be written in a simpler way ?”
        * Single responsibility. Each function should only do one thing
        * You aren’t gonna need it (YAGNI). Do not add unnecessary codes you think you might need. Wait till you need it
        * Use proper names for variables, functions and classes to describe intent. Avoid using abbreviations or generic names. A function or class should do exactly what the name says
        * Initialise variables just-in-time (Mayfly variables)
        * Use positive conditionals. Do not be anti-negative
        * Use ternary operators ( condition ? true_value : false_value) instead of simple if else statements. However, avoid using nested ternaries
        * Reduce if/else statements. Most often, we don’t need an else statement, as we can just use return inside the ‘if’ statement
        * Avoid complex conditionals, instead, use intermediate variables or encapsulate via function
        * Prefer declarative over imperative. Use tools like Linq to filter over data structures
        * Avoid using magic numbers or magic strings, instead, use constants or enums where necessary.
        * Avoid unnecessary comments. Codes should self-documenting
        * Avoid excessive indentations in your functions
        * Switch to table driven methods instead of hard-coding different values e.g. pricing options, tax rates
        * High number of parameters make codes unreadable. If there are too many parameters, it may be violating single responsibilities. Max 3 parameters
        * Avoid having long functions. Scrolling should not be required. Functions should not be longer than 20 lines
        * Return early, Fail fast and Fail loud. Have Guard clauses. If you can’t handle exception throw it, do not just leave it
        * Methods in a class should be related. Otherwise split up classes with low cohesion
